3.1: boisebouldering.rocks
3.2: I looked up 'find a domain name' on google and on Google Domains I typed in 'BoiseBouldering' and scrolled down until
I found a TLD that I liked.
3.3: From the website where the .rocks TLD came from: 
".rocks is a great way to promote yourself, your band or anything else you love. 
It's also an obvious choice for anyone who works with, uh, rocks."
I couldn't resist this option given how bouldering works with rocks. It was a perfect fit.
